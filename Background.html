<h3>CMP Express Highway Performance Comparatorâ€”Background and Introduction </h3>
<p>
Purpose
<p>
The Express Highway Performance Comparator application compares roadway conditions on expressways in the Boston region between the years 2012 and 2015. The roadway conditions are reported in the form of performance measurement data. The performance measures used in this application include Average Travel Speed, Speed Index, Congested Time, Delay per Mile, and Travel Time Index.
<p>
Definitions of Performance Measures
<p>
	<p>
	<strong>Average Travel Speed</strong> is associated with specific roadway Traffic Message Channels (TMCs) and is calculated using travel times and segment lengths. The average observed travel speed is a good indicator of lack of mobility in a roadway network and is used for determining solutions to mobility problems.
	<li>
		Average Travel Speed = Total speed value for all data samples / total number of data samples
	</li>	
	</p>
<p>
	<strong>Speed Index</strong> indicates congestion more accurately than travel speed alone because low travel speed may be a result of low speed limits on certain facilities.
	<li>
	Speed Index = average speed / posted speed limit (of a TMC)
	</li>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Congested Time</strong> (measured in minutes per peak-period hour) is the average number of minutes that drivers experience congested conditions during the peak period. Congestion is considered to persist when the average speed is less than 35 miles per hour (mph) on a limited-access roadway.
	<li>
	Congested Time = (number of samples with congestion below speed threshold / number of samples used) x number of minutes in measured period
	</li>	
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Delay per Mile</strong> (displayed in seconds per mile) shows the extra time needed to traverse a TMC or corridor. This performance measure is presented in a per-mile metric to emphasize the intensity of congestion.
	<li>
	Delay per Mile = (average travel time - free flow travel time) / segment length
	</li>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Travel Time Index</strong> directly compares peak-period travel time conditions with free-flow travel time conditions. Travel Time Index indicates how much contingency time should be considered to ensure an on-time arrival during the peak period versus optimum travel times.
	<li> Travel Time Index = average peak-period travel time / free-flow travel time
	</li>
</p>

<p>
Table Attributes
<p>
<p>
Traffic Message Channel: A technology used to communicate traffic conditions to motorists. TMCs are a universal standard that define the beginning and end of roadway segments for several global positioning system (GPS) monitoring companies. TMC segments on limited-access roadways often, but not always, extend either from interchange to interchange or span the entire interchange.
<p>
<p>
Community(ies): List of communities in which the TMC is located
<p>
<p>
Beginning at: Approximate start location of the TMC
<p>
<p>
Ending at: Approximate end location of the TMC 
<p>
<p>
Length (Miles): Directional length of the TMC 
<p>
<p>
Number of Lanes: Number of lanes per TMC (provided by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) roadway inventory)
<p>
<p>
Speed Limit: Posted speed limit for a TMC (provided by the MassDOT roadway inventory) 
<p>
<p>
Average Speed: See above definition (2012-2015 comparison shows the change in average speed between 2012 and 2015).
<p>
<p>
Speed Index: See above definition (2012-2015 comparison shows the change in Speed Index between 2012 and 2015).
<p>
<p>
Congested Time: See above definition (2012-2015 comparison shows the change in Congested Time between 2012 and 2015).
<p>
<p>
Delay per Mile: See above definition (2012-2015 comparison shows the change in Delay per Mile between 2012 and 2015).
<p>
<p>
Average Travel-Time Index: See above definition (2012-2015 comparison shows the change in Average Travel-Time Index between 2012 and 2015).
