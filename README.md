# express-highway-performance-comparator
App to compare 2 sets of CMP performance stats for express highways

This application makes use of the following external resources:
* Version 1.11.1 of the jQuery library
* Version 2.4.3 of the Proj4.js library
* Version 4.2.0 of the OpenLayers library
* Version 4.8.0 of the D3 library
* The D3-tip library
* The CTPS AccessibleGrid Library (in a separate repo)
* A custom build of version 2.8.2 of the modernizr.js library to test for SVG support in the browser

All data is fetched from a PostGIS database running on the MPO's external webserver.

NOTE: THIS APP WAS DEVELOPED BY ETHAN EBINGER. 

I (BEN KREPP) AM MERELY COMITTING ETHAN'S CODE TO GitHub TO ENSURE THAT THIS TASK IS COMPLETED WHILE HE IS OTHERWISE ENGAGED.
